    (The first paragraph is to set the base of the story.)
   </p>
   <p>
    (in context of fathers/Men....)We all have our good days and bad days. Some express them, some endure in silence. Among them stands the men who never complains, who works hard for their families, for example they never say ki aaj main bus mein ya train mein dhaka khate huye gaya aur mujhe bethne ki jagh bhi nhi mili, fir office mein aaj ek deadline puri nhi kr paya toh boss ne sunaya...etc.
   </p>
   <p>
    and then come the fathers, for us they didn't have bad days from years, i even lost the count of the days, so i guess you are also one of those who have a great father, <b>and by watching him you learn to be patient, kind, gentle, hardworking, thinks about family every time.... so, cheers to another year where you are becoming a man who carries the weight of responsibilities with grace, who puts others before himself, who, just like his father, stands tall always.</b>
   </p>
   <p>
    I think a man is a beautiful creation of God and Fathers are the good example of it.

    I think one of the greatest lessons you learn from your mother is to expect nothing, yet to always prioritize the well-being of those around her. They say that mothers are the first woman in any man's life, and the first teacher of every kid so, here's to the woman who gave you life, and who is always there by your side no matter what, without any expectations.

    We meet new people along the way of life, and we get to know there stories, but sometimes we don't know the stories of those who are always there with us, so, this is the reminder for you to spend time with them, sbhi ke pass hote hai apne kuch kisse kuch kahaniya, aur the lessons they learned in life in hard way...(if already done then leave my bakwas as it is, and move on to the next one...)
